I was licensed in September of 2025, with the A qualification.I enjoy talking on the BR7JCC repeater.I am now using Baofeng UV26M with its original antenna or yagi antenna to talk on HF.When I get a B qualification,I will use 
YAESU FT-891 to talk on SortWave.

Also, if your sending a qsl card to me, you can take a look at the information in the part of QSL.Sending A QSL card with Email is also allowed.

Hope to hear you on the air!

VY73!
